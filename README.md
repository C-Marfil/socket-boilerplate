# SOCKET.IO BOILERPLATE

A simple server and client repo we created following a YouTube tutorial.
We could develop the app from here.

To try ``` npm start ``` a terminal within CLIENT and another terminal within SERVER.

Open two tabs (one incognito) and access your localhost.

If the room you join matches, you can swap messages from one tab to another.

There is plenty of ways we could make different events and messages so there's a multiplayer engagement going on.
